  "introduction": [
    "This game is our team's take on what a 2-player version of the iconic \"Snake\" might have looked like and was developed over two weeks for a game jam. Initially, for this game jam, our team was going to develop a different 2-player game that we prototyped and ended up scraping because we felt that the main gimmick of the game was not strong/clear enough for us to continue development. With only roughly 10 days remaining for the game jam, our team struggled to come up with a game idea that really excited us which led us to attempt iterating on an existing game idea, Snake.",
    "My main contributions to the project are the UI animations, input buffering, and other polish elements such as the screen shake."

    "Through this project, I learned the importance of prototyping. As mentioned above, we initially planned for a completely different game idea which in hindsight was never really going to work. But at that point in time, it seemed like a good idea and that's where prototyping quickly helped us avoid wasting more development time on that idea.",
    "In the end, I think we executed the game idea well with a very high level of polish given the time frame. However, I do believe the game would benefit from more balancing updates. Currently, the game starts off very tense and evenly matched between the players however as one players gains a small advantage, that advantage snowballs which makes it very difficult for the other player to comeback which is not what our team was intending."
